        <h1>I'm Truly Sorry 💔</h1>
        <p>I just want to take a moment to say I'm really sorry for everything I said earlier. 😞 I know I hurt you, and that was never my intention. The truth is, I was frustrated and struggling to express how I really feel, but that’s no excuse for the way I acted. 💔</p>
        <p>The last thing I ever want to do is make you feel unimportant or unloved. You mean so much to me, and it pains me to know that my words hurt you. 😔 I wish I had handled things differently, and I regret saying things I didn’t truly mean.</p>
        <p>I hope you can forgive me. 🤍 I promise to communicate better and not let my emotions take over like that again. You’re incredibly special to me, and I don’t want our misunderstandings to ever come between us. 🤝💖</p>
        <p>Take your time, and whenever you're ready, I’d love to talk and make things right. 🫂✨</p>
        <p>I love you, and I’m truly sorry. 💕</p>
